# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
 Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise understand what months have shown proven success in fundraising a Theater. Since Louise's primary focus is to create a play and making sure that it is successful, we then have to understand how much we would want to consider setting our fundraising goal too. We are aware that not every play is successful and we want to understand why. We can find a corrilation that setting a goal too high or too low might be the primary cause. So, we now want to figure out what goal has shown to be the most successful one. Once we figure that out, we will know what months to consider starting Louises fundraiser in and what goal we would like to accomplish, all to ensure that Louise comes out successful.
## Analysis and Challenges
With the data that we were given, we first had to seperate the data so that we are only focusing on the data related to theater. By doing so we created a Pivot Table of all the data and filtered it to show only what we wanted to see. We wanted to see only the data realted to Theater, more specifically the amount of successful, failed and canceled fundraisers each month. Once we have that data available, we then created a line chart so we can visually see the trends of which month has shown the most success, failed and canceled fundraisers.
The Line Chart is shown here

The challenges that could have been encountered is not being able to create a pivot table to accurately show the data we are trying to find. Understanding what to place in colums and rows specifically.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
My first analysis is that there were hardly any theaters that canceled on launch date. The number of failed Theaters has shown to be fairly consistant at about 40 failed each month. Since we want to make sure Louise is successful, we notice that May, June and July are the peak months and those are the months we would want to focus out efforts on when releasing our new play. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When we start looking more specifically at Plays, which is Louis's primary focus in the Theater world, we notice there is a very semetrical correlation between failed and successful plays when trying to achieve a certain fundraidsing goal. To make sure Louise sets a successful goal we want to decide on either making it less than 4999, or between 35000 to 44999, with less than 4999 being the more successful of the two options. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The most difficulty that I have encountered is creating the Outcomes Based on Goals. I have not been able to get my chart to look like it is suppose to. My understanding is that I my formulars are not correct which is pulling in incorrect information.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The two conclusion that I can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date is that there are hardly any Theaters that have canceled on their launch date, and that May, June and July are proven to be the most successful months of them all.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
There is a very precise semetrical correlation between successful goals and failed goals. The more successful a goal is, the less there is a chance for a play to fail to meet that goal and vice versa.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitations that I have noticed is that we are focused on the months alone, we have to take in consideration that those data sets are also spread out over the course 7 years. Is there a correlation to the success rates and what year it is in. What if the population interest in plays have decreased over the years, we may need to factor that in as well.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Line charts are the best to represent the data that is spread over time. Other graphs to consider would be a pie graph as it would present percentages as a whole much more clear from a visual aspect.
